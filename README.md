Yet another simple password generator for android

It allows to generate passwords based on a master password hardcoded in MainActivity.java and a variable keyword the user must type, these keywords combined and MD5'd generates the password

Two passwords are generated, click one or another to copy it to the clipboard

Assign a shortcut to pwmaker for quick access whenever you need it


Warning!

If you are planning to use it, just remember to change the master passwords in MainActivity.java
